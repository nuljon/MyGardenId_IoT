TO DOs ===================================================================================

	write motor control function for valve
	write scheduling module to schedule irrigation, logging sensor data, and log file backups
	wire the index.html file to realtime sensor data instead of just logs
	update sensor logging
		- allow only one entry per hour
		- log barometer as a rolling average combining current reading with last 3 log entries 
		- add a field to record if barometer direction - steady, rising or falling

	add DDNS and setup DMZ in router for public http access

	create a sleep manager to save power- only wake for scheduled events, comm check and interrupts

DONE	write data aggregation routine for creating daydata.csv file for terend chart


************************   SERVICE OPTIMIZATIONS   ***************************************


	create a general event log to capture device activity besides sensor readings
		
	write an admin page

	write a backup routine for sensor logs
	
	move all inline styles to css/custom.css and minify
    
    	experiment moving majority of inline script to js/main.js  
    
    	test serving the masthead graphic from the html file as base-64 inline code 

DONE	host masthead graphic on nuljon.com insted of SPIFFS

DONE	use CDN to host Framework libraries instead of SPIFFS (JQUERY, Tether, and Bootstrap)

DONE	use nuljon.com as a psuedo CDN to host JQwidget directory and JS directory
    
DONE	minfy and gzip index.html on SPIFFS

DONE	gzip favicon.ico on SPIFFS
	
PART	minify all text based files hosted on nuljon.com (.js, .css)

	Create a RESTful service on nuljon.com to act as data repository for MGidIoT to post logs

	create a scheduled back-up of logs once data respository exists

    
**************************   SECURITY OPTIMIZATIONS    ***********************************

      	create an admin page with the following attributes
		    
                accessible only via authenticated websocket on local network
    
                allows modify sensors - soil moisture threshold, barometer rolling average range

		allows modify irrigation schedule 
    
                allows modify logging interval
    
                real-time control of water valve (override schedule)

                update firmware - requires acess to device (interlock switch)

		allows modify FS - uploads and deletes to SPIFFS log files, html files, images, etc.
	
	disable unecessary webserver request handlers in the codebase

	disbable unecessary WIFI functions, such as AP mode

	disable arduino OTA upon coverage by admin page

	impliment a hashing system to secure Admin communications that includes:

		- set up a server on local network to generate all admin client communications

		- authenticate messages via a secret known only to MGidIoT and local server

		- secret is used to seed the hash - never transmit secret over the network
		
		- allow local wifi or LAN to access admin functions via HTML form hosted on server

		- provide remote access to admin functions via VPN
